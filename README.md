# Kent css
The only css framework on the internet created by me (Jared). Kent is a simple, minimal, and custom css framework built using scss and relying on flexbox!

## Getting started with Kent
Install with `npm install kent-css` or fork the project on [Github](https://github.com/Jaredk3nt/Kent).

Kent comes with a pre-compiled CSS file `/css/kent.css` so you don't have to do that work!

Check out the [documentation](https://github.com/Jaredk3nt/Kent/wiki/Documentation) for more information on using Kent.

## License
Kent is licensed under the open source [MIT license](https://github.com/Jaredk3nt/Kent/blob/master/LICENSE).
